## Architecture

The SampleTodo application follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern for a structured and scalable architecture. Here's a brief overview of each component:

- **Model**: Contains the data structures and logic for tasks, including the title, description, and completion status.
- **View**: Handles the user interface and displays the tasks to the user. Provides input fields for creating and editing tasks.
- **ViewModel**: Acts as a mediator between the Model and View, providing data and methods for manipulating tasks. Handles CoreData interactions for data persistence.
